Activities through 3/6 (through break)
======================================

You have the following graded activities:

* Before Wednesday's class:
   * Read :ref:`Sorting<sort_chap>`, and do the exercises in that chapter
   * Read :ref:`Importing modules<modules_chap>`

   .. usageassignment:: prep_13
    :chapters: Sort, PythonModules
    :subchapters: Installation/pip
    :assignment_name: Prep a13
    :deadline: 2016-02-26 06:00:00
    :pct_required: 80
    :points: 50

* Before **March 6, the Sunday at the end of break:**
   * Starting this week, the main problem set is distributed via Canvas. There is an assignment called `PS 7 <https://umich.instructure.com/courses/48961/assignments/55801>`_. It includes a file called ``ps7.py``. You should download a copy of it. You will edit it on your laptop or workstation using Sublime Text and test it by running it using your native Python interpreter. You will also need to download a file called ``106test.py``. It contains the testEqual function that gives you feedback on whether you have correctly implemented various things in the problem set. (You must save these two files in the *same directory* in order to run PS 7 with your native Python interpreter -- see importing modules readings!)
   * Submit your .py file via Canvas.
   * You also have a Demonstrate Understanding due by 6 PM (with the usual 5 minute grace period) on March 6.
   * Note that you do not need to submit Unix Problems this time, but you DO need to learn a new Unix Command in order to do this problem set, and you will be responsible for understanding it as we move forward.
