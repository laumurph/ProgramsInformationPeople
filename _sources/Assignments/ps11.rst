Drupal is a "Content Management System" that makes it relatively easy to develop websites that have dynamic content and interactive features like commenting and tagging. (Note: it may be helpful in reading the article to know that "Dries" is `Dries Buytaert <http://buytaert.net/>`_, the person who started Drupal and "webchick" is the username chosen by `Angie Byron <http://www.webchick.net/about>`_, a prominent member of the community.)
    * Complete `Reading Response 11 <https://umich.instructure.com/courses/48961/assignments/57687>`_ on Canvas.


* **Before Wednesday's class:**
       * Read the Pong subchapter of the :ref:`Pyglet<pyglet_chap>` chapter in the textbook, and review the earlier sections as necessary.
       * From Canvas, download the code file basepong.py and print out the PDFs basepong.pdf and LecturePongQuestions.pdf
       * Write down your answers to Questions 1-11 from LecturePongQuestions.pdf before class and bring them with you to class. We will go over answers to those questions and then you will work with others in class to try to answer the rest of them.
