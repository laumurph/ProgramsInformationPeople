Problem Set
-----------

.. _problem_set_6:


.. activecode:: ps_6_1
   :language: python

   Use a for loop to print the second element of each tuple in the list ``new_tuple_list``.

   ~~~~
   new_tuple_list = [(1,2),(4, "umbrella"),("chair","hello"),("soda",56.2)]


.. activecode:: ps_6_2
   :language: python

    Write three assignment statements with function calls to the function ``give_greeting``:

      * one that will return the string ``Hello, SI106!!!``
      * one that will return the string ``Hello, world!!!``
      * and one that will return the string ``Hey, everybody!``

   You must write only the ``print`` command and function invocations of ``give_greeting`` to earn full credit on this problem.

   You can see the function definition in the code below, but that's only so you can understand exactly what the code is doing, so you can choose how to invoke this function. Feel free to make comments to help yourself understand, but otherwise DO NOT change the function definition code! **HINT:** calling the function with different inputs and printing the results, to see what happens, may be helpful! Make sure your final answer prints out all three of the strings listed above.

   ~~~~
   def give_greeting(greet_word="Hello",name="SI106",num_exclam=3):
       final_string = greet_word + ", " + name + "!"*num_exclam
       return final_string

   #### DO NOT change the function definition above this line (OK to add comments)

   # Write your three print statements with function calls below

   ====

   print "TODO ADD TESTS FOR THIS, TEAM"


.. activecode:: ps_6_3
   :language: python

   Define a function called ``mult_both`` whose input is two integers, whose default parameter values are the integers 3 and 4. The function's return value should be the two input integers multiplied together.

   ~~~~
   # Write your code here

   =====

   from unittest.gui import TestCaseGui

   class myTests(TestCaseGui):

      def testOne(self):
         self.assertEqual(mult_both(), 12, "Testing whether your function works as expected (calling the function mult_both)")
         self.assertEqual(mult_both(5,10), 50, "Testing whether your function works as expected (calling the function mult_both)")

   myTests().main()


.. activecode:: ps_6_4
   :language: python

   You can get data from Facebook that has nested structures which represent posts, or users, or various other types of things on Facebook. We won't put any of our actual Facebook group data on this textbook, because the textbook is publicly available on the internet, but here's a structure that is almost exactly the same as the real thing, with fake data.

   Notice that the stuff in the variable ``fb_data`` is basically a big nested dictionary, with dictionaries and lists, strings and integers, inside it as keys and values. 

   (Later in the course we'll learn how to get this kind of thing directly FROM facebook, and then it will be a bit more complicated and have real information from our Facebook group.)

   **FIRST,** look through the data structure saved in the variable ``fb_data`` to get a sense for it. 

   Here are some questions to consider. We won't grade your answers to these questions, but we suggest that you write them in the code as comments. They may help you think through this big nested data structure. You can test your answers using print statements. e.g. ``print type(fb_data["data"])``
      
   * What type is the structure saved in the variable ``fb_data``?
   * What type does the expression ``fb_data["data"]`` evaluate to?
   * What about ``fb_data["data"][1]``?
   * What about ``fb_data["data"][0]["from"]``?
   * What about ``fb_data["data"][0]["id"]``?

   Write a line of code to assign the value of the first message (``"This problem might..."`` from the big ``fb_data`` data structure to a variable called ``first_message``. Do not hard code your answer! (So, write it in terms of ``fb_data``, so that it would work with any content stored in the variable ``fb_data`` which has the same structure as that of what we gave you.)

   Write a second line of code to assign the value of the name of the second person who posted (``"John Smythe"``) to a variable called ``second_name``. Do not hard code your answer!

   ~~~~

   In the next few questions, youâ€™ll build components and then a complete program that lets people play Hangman. Below is an image from the middle of a game...

   .. image:: Figures/HangmanSample.JPG

   See the flow chart below for a better understanding of what's happening in the code for the Hangman game overall.
 
   .. image:: Figures/HangmanFlowchart.jpg

   Your first task is just to understand the logic of the program, by matching up elements of the flow chart above with elements of the code below. In later problems, you'll fill in a few details that aren't fully implemented here.  

   For this question, write which lines of code go with which lines of the flow chart box, by answering the questions in comments at the bottom of this activecode box. 

   .. note::

      You may find it helpful to run this program in order to understand it. It will tell you feedback about your last guess, but won't tell you where the correct letters were or how much health you have, and it won't stop if you guess all the letters, so you can't *really* play with this version of the code. Allowing the game to do those things is what you'll do in later problems!

   The next task you have is to create a correct version of the ``blanked`` function. It should take 2 inputs: a word, and a string of the letters that have been guessed already. 

   It should return a string with the same number of characters as the word, but with the UNrevealed characters replaced by an underscore (a ``_``). 

   **HINT:** Iterate through the letters in the word, accumulating characters as you go. If you try to iterate through the guesses, it's harder.

   ~~~~       
   # Sample calls to this function
   # (Remember, these won't work until you define the function blanked)
   print blanked("hello", "elj")
   #should output _ell_
   print blanked("almost","amsvr")
   # should output a_m_s_ 


   =====

   from unittest.gui import TestCaseGui

   class myTests(TestCaseGui):

      def testOne(self):
         self.assertEqual(blanked('hello', 'elj'), "_ell_", "testing blanking of hello when e,l, and j have been guessed.")
         self.assertEqual(blanked('hello', ''), '_____', "testing blanking of hello when nothing has been guessed.")
         self.assertEqual(blanked('ground', 'rn'), '_r__n_', "testing blanking of ground when r and n have been guessed.")
         self.assertEqual(blanked('almost', 'vrnalmqpost'), 'almost', "testing blanking of almost when all the letters have been guessed.")

   myTests().main()


.. activecode:: ps_6_7
   :language: python

   Now you have to create a good version of the ``health_prompt`` function: 

   Define a function called ``health_prompt``. The first parameter should be the current health the player has (an integer), and the second parameter should be the maximum health a player can have (an integer). 

   The function should return a string with ``+`` signs for the current health, and ``-`` signs for the health that has been lost so far.

   ~~~~
   # Define your function here.




   # Sample invocations of the function.

   print health_prompt(3, 7)
   #this statement should produce the output
   #health: +++----

   print health_prompt(0, 4)
   #this statement should produce the output
   #health: ----

   =====

   from unittest.gui import TestCaseGui

   class myTests(TestCaseGui):

      def testOne(self):
         self.assertEqual(health_prompt(3,7), "+++----", "Testing health_prompt(3,7)")
         self.assertEqual(health_prompt(0,4), "----", "Testing health_prompt(0,4)")
         self.assertEqual(health_prompt(5,5), "+++++", "Testing health_prompt(5,5)")

.. question:: problem_set_6_8

   You have all the pieces of a fully functioning hangman program! Now you can put together a program on your own computer to play Hangman.

   In the below code window is all of the code for the hangman program, *except* for the two functions you just defined in problems 6 and 7. (It does not include the special lines allowing it to run in the textbook, and it does not have those function definitions, so this code will not run as expected! It's just provided here for you to copy.)

   Copy your two function definitions, from the last two problems, into a *Python file* on your computer, just like ``prog1.py`` from last week, except much more complicated a program. Save that file as ``hangman.py``.

   Then copy all the code in the box below into that file, too, underneat the function definitions you just copied in.

   Finally, make one more change to the program: add a little bit of code so that after a user types in a secret word to guess, 27 blank lines are printed. 

   (This will let you play the game with a friend -- after you enter in a word, a bunch of blank lines will print out, and then when they get the computer to play, they won't see the word you typed!)

   Save this Python program, and run it with the command line: ``cd`` to the correct directory where you saved the file, and then type ``python hangman.py``, as you learned last week.

   **Submit** your python file called hangman.py AND a screenshot of you successfully running the code and playing the game to `Problem 6 Unix Exercises <UPDATELINK>`_ on Canvas.
