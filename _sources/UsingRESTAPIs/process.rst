Process the Contents
====================

The last step is to process the contents.

Often, when you get back data in json format, it will be a highly nested data structure. You may only need a little of that data. Pulling out what you want is a big topic to warrant an entire chapter of its own, later in the book.

The key lesson for now is to make sure you have received the data you were expecting before you start writing code to extract elements out of that data.
