Activities through 10/19
========================

You have the following graded activities:

* **Before Monday's class 10/10:**
    
  * Read :ref:`While loops<while_chap>`, and do the exercises in that chapter
  * *If you use a Windows computer,* read and do the installation in the (:ref:`instructions for installing git bash <install_git_bash>`). 
  * Read :ref:`Installing a text editor<text_editor_installation>` and the subsequent sections on installing and running python. Try to do the exercises and installations. You will address any installation problems you have (hopefully none!) in section this week. 

.. usageassignment

* **By Tuesday 10/11 11:59 pm:**
    * Read *The Most Human Human*, Chapter 10, p.219-237.
    * Answer `Reading Response 6 <https://umich.instructure.com/courses/105657/assignments/131317>`_ on Canvas.

* **Before Wednesday's class 10/12:**
    
  * Read :ref:`Unix and the Command Line<unix_chapter>`, and try out the commands you learn -- in Terminal, if you use a mac, or Git Bash, if you use Windows.
  * Read `this tutorial on Unix pipes <http://www.ee.surrey.ac.uk/Teaching/Unix/unix3.html>`_ (you can ignore the ``who`` command in the tutorial) and `this tutorial on the Unix command grep <http://www.ee.surrey.ac.uk/Teaching/Unix/unix2.html>`_ (you can scroll down to it on that page).

.. usageassignment

* By Friday 10/14 at 6:30 PM:
   * Complete the :ref:`Unix Exercises for Problem Set 5 <problem_set_5_unix>`. (Half the problem set)
   * Save answers to the exercises in Problem Set 5: :ref:`Problem Set 5 <problem_set_5>` (the other half of the problem set)
   * Submit your **Demonstrate Understanding** assignment on Canvas

* **By Wednesday 10/19, after fall break:**
   * Be ready for the midterm exam, see syllabus.

   * Updated study materials will be announced via Canvas.

   * Suggested practice for making best use of the problem sets for review
      * Go through all the problem sets, looking at your answers and fixing them if they weren't correct.
      * Then make another pass through the problem sets. This time, don't look at your past answer or any solution set. Write new answers from scratch. See how quickly you can solve them. Make a note of any problems that take you a long time to solve.
      * Repeat as necessary. On later iterations of this process, only redo the problems that you did not solve immediately on the previous iteration.
  * There are practice problems in all Extra Exercises sections, and some additional ones at the bottom of this page. Some have solutions. They are *not* required, but may be helpful if you are looking for more study material. Try writing your answers out on paper and checking them here!

Problem Set

.. datafile:: timely_file.txt
   :hide:

   Autumn is interchangeably known as fall in the US and Canada, and is one of the four temperate seasons. Autumn marks the transition from summer into winter.
   Some cultures regard the autumn equinox as mid autumn while others, with a longer temperature lag, treat it as the start of autumn then. 
   In North America, autumn starts with the September equinox, while it ends with the winter solstice. 
   (Wikipedia)



.. activecode:: ps_5_1

   **1.** Write code **that will keep printing what the user inputs over and over until the user enters the string "quit".**

   ~~~~
   # Write code here

   ====

   print "\n---\n\n"
   print "There are no tests for this problem"


.. activecode:: ps_5_2
   :available_files: timely_file.txt
   :language: python

   **2.** We've given you another data file in this problem. It's called ``timely_file.txt``. Write code to figure out which is the most common word in the file. Save the string that is most common word in the file in the variable ``abc``. (Hint: there was a problem on last week's problem set that is very similar to this one.)

   ~~~~
   # Write code here!
        
   =====

   from unittest.gui import TestCaseGui

   class myTests(TestCaseGui):

      def testOne(self):
         self.assertEqual(abc, 'the', "testing whether abc is set correctly.")

   myTests().main()


.. activecode:: ps_5_3
   :language: python

   **3.** Below is a function definition. **DO NOT** change it! 

   We have also provided some invocations of that function. Run those and see what they do.

   Below the comment provided in the code window, write a few calls to this function yourself, with whatever appropriate input you want.

   Finally, write a few sentences in comments in the code window that explain what's happening in this function called list_end_with_string. You should explain what happens if a list like ``l`` gets input into this function AND what happens if a list like ``b`` gets input into it. 

   Don't forget to run it and save!

   ~~~~
   # Function definition
   def list_end_with_string(new_list):
       if type(new_list[-1]) == type("hello"):
           return new_list
       new_list.append("the last element is a string no matter what now!")
       return new_list

   # Now write a couple invocations of this function yourself below this line.


   # Write your comments here.

   :language: python

   **4.** Define a function ``is_prefix`` that takes two strings as inputs and returns the boolean value ``True`` if the first string is a prefix of the second string, but returns ``False`` otherwise.

   ~~~~   
   # Define your function here.


   # Here's a couple example function calls, printing the return value
   # to show you what it is.
   print is_prefix("He","Hello") # should print True
   print is_prefix("Hello","He") # should print False
   print is_prefix("Hi","Hello") # should print False
   print is_prefix("lo","Hello") # should print False
   print is_prefix("Hel","Hello") # should print True
   # Remember, these won't work at all until you have defined a function called is_prefix

   myTests().main()


.. activecode:: ps_5_9
   :available_files: timely_file.txt

   **5.** Define a python function ``grep`` that works just like the unix command ``grep``. Your function should take two inputs, a string and a filename. It should return a list of all the lines in the file that contain the string, and only the lines in the file that contain the string.

   ~~~~
   # Write code here!

   What is the last character of the string value in the variable ``pl``? Find it and print it. This should work no matter what string value ``pl`` has.

   What is the last character of each element in the list ``plts``? Print the last character of each element in the list on a separate line. HINT: You should NOT have to count the length of any of these strings manually/by yourself.

   Write code to print out the string "Why hello, Irene" using the variable ``nm``.

   Write code to print "Nice to meet you," in front of each element in list ``hlt`` on a separate line. e.g. ``Nice to meet you, mycroft`` and ``Nice to meet you, Lestrade``

   Write code to print the length of the list ``fancy_tomatoes``.

   Write code to print out each element of the list ``fancy_tomatoes`` on a separate line. (You can do this in just 2 lines of code!)

   Now write code to print out the type of each element of the list fancy_tomatoes on a separate line.

   ~~~~
   fancy_tomatoes = ["hello", 6, 4.24, 8, 20, "newspaper", True, "goodbye", "False", False, 5967834, "6578.31"]

.. activecode:: rv_1_8
   :language: python

   The following code runs, but not the way we expect it to. **You want to print out the first character of each string in the list of strings.** So the following output should print out:

   ::

      h
      g
      l
      4
      6

   Instead, you'll see something different when you run the code. Go through it carefully, understand what is happening, and then fix the code so that the output above appears. Good practice: explain to someone else (or yourself) why exactly it is working incorrectly (semantic errors!) and what is happening on each line, and then fix it.

   ~~~~
   list_of_strings = ["hello","goodbye","lampshade","45","63"]
   for i in list_of_strings:
       if i in list_of_strings:
